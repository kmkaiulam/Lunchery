# Lunchery

## Summary
A lunch sharing app for the workplace. For aspiring chefs and the hard worker or just doesn't have time to cook.  Modern design. Built on React.

## Motivation
I love cooking for other people, and there are few greater pasttimes than talking to my co-workers about the next special lunch that we were planning. Lunchery was born out of a desire to connect people in the workplace around the lunch table and the frustration of spending up to half the lunch hour going out to get a decent meal. Whether you're a chef or just someone looking for a nice home-cooked meal while at work I hope Lunchery helps bring people together.
